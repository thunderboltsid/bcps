### Motivation
Income Sharing Agreements (ISAs) are a new way to finance education. They allow students to pay for their education after they graduate and secure a job. The student agrees to pay a fixed percentage of their income for a fixed period of time. This project aims to provide a simple tool to predict the payment schedule for an ISA based on the student's income.

ISAs like  ðŸ§ ðŸ¤‘ can be rather expensive compared to a traditional education loan depending on your income. This tool aims to provide transparency and clarity to students who are considering entering into an ISA.
